File containing the goal query statement: gqs_1.txt
Goal query statement in the file:     [ Nil AP x1 AP x2 ]
Goal query statement (after parsing): [ Nil AP x1 AP x2 ]
FO-CTL Statement (after translation): (exist x1 [(exist x2 [AF (x1 && AX AF x2)])])
Extended FO-CTL Statement for WCD:    EF (exist x1 [(exist x2 [AF (x1 && AX AF x2)])])

Creating path-based environment...


Before design... 
Solution found
Partial solution: EF @29 (exist GB [exist Ghack [AF @29 ((GB) && (AX (AF @39 (Ghack))))]])
Path to one of the worst states: [2 8 14 15 16 22 28 29]
Path length to the worst states: 7
The WCD: 6

After design... 
Partial solution: EF @27 (exist GB [exist Gexit [AF @29 ((GB) && (AX (AF @41 (Gexit))))]])
Path to one of the worst states: [2 8 14 20 26 27]
Path length to the worst states: 5
The WCD: 4
