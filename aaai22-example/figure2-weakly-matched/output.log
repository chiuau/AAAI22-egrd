File containing the goal query statement: gqs.txt
Goal query statement in the file:     [ Nil AP x1* AP x2 ]
Goal query statement (after parsing): [ Nil AP x1* AP x2 ]
FO-CTL Statement (after translation): (exist x2 [AF (exist x1 [(x1 && AX AF x2)])])
Extended FO-CTL Statement for WCD:    EF (exist x2 [AF (exist x1 [(x1 && AX AF x2)])])

Creating path-based environment...


Before design... 
Solution found
Partial solution: EF @10 (exist Ghack [AF @29 (exist GB [(GB) && (AX (AF @39 (Ghack)))])])
Path to one of the worst states: [2 3 4 10]
Path length to the worst states: 3
The WCD: 2

After design... 
No better design solution
