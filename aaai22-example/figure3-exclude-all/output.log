File containing the goal query statement: gqs.txt
Goal query statement in the file:     [ Nil AP (x and XA_{x}) AP_{XA} End ]
Goal query statement (after parsing): [ Nil AP (x and XA_{x}) AP_{XA} End ]
FO-CTL Statement (after translation): (exist x [AF ((x && (forall x1 not_in {x} [(!x1)])) && (Last || AX AG (forall x2 [(!x2)])))])
Extended FO-CTL Statement for WCD:    EF (exist x [AF ((x && (forall x1 not_in {x} [(!x1)])) && (Last || AX AG (forall x2 [(!x2)])))])

Creating path-based environment...


Before design... 
Solution found
Partial solution: EF @23 (exist G2 [AF @24 (((G2) && (forall G1 [!_])) && ((Last) || _))])
Path to one of the worst states: [2 7 12 17 22 23]
Path length to the worst states: 5
The WCD: 4

After design... 
Partial solution: EF @3 (exist G2 [AF @24 (((G2) && (forall G1 [!_])) && ((Last) || _))])
Path to one of the worst states: [2 3]
Path length to the worst states: 1
The WCD: 0
